# stm32-slcan
Simple SLCAN example using an STM32L433, to document my own learnings with respect to STM32 development and CAN bus usage.

I used an Butterfly deleopment module from https://www.tindie.com/products/tleracorp/butterfly-stm32l433-development-board/

I used STM32CubeMX and Atollic TrueStudio to do the development, meaning I did not use the Arduino environment that came with the Butterfly module.
